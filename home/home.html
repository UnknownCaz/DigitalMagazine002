I live with my; grandma, my two sisters, and my aunt Amanda (who will soon be moving out to find a new apartment). I have the second smallest room, and its pretty much filled with electronics</p>

        <td>The main living room houses most of my family. Its large and connects openly to the kitchen with a bar off to the side, we own a decently large T.V </td>
        <td>The kitchen is around the same size as the living room. We have a table, but we dont really use it that often for food because we eat in the living room.</td>
        <td>My bedroom is made of; my bed<sup>duh</sup>, my computer set up; which is just at the foot of my bed, my speakers; those sit upon a bedrest.</td>
