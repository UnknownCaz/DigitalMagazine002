				<p>At Home I'm the oldest child of three. I have two sisters their respective names and ages are Maizie<sup>(12) </sup>and Alina<sup>(11)</sup>. I live with my Grandma Dawn she's raised me since I was born. Although my mother hasn't been in my life a lot she is currently working on being a part of it. We live in a module home out in the country, and although our house is small, I've never had issue with it.</p>
